# Retrospective for Sprint 1
# What went well:
* Almost all of the user stories have been completed.
* All members commited and reviewed code.
# What didn't go well:
* The user story names didn't describe the problem properly.
* Communication between the team wasn't optimal, resulting in conflicts.
* We didn't add acceptance tests.
* We didn't add estimated times for stories.
# Plan going forward:
* User story names have been updated.
* Acceptance tests have been added.
* Estimated times have been added.
* Stories have been distributed evenly.
* Leftover stories have been moved to sprint 2
* Improve communication, for instance by improving reviews, communicating issues and letting others know what files we are working on to prevent conflicts.

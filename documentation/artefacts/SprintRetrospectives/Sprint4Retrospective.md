# Retrospective for Sprint 4
# What went well:
* Project has been completed with most of the functionality in place
# What didn't go well:
* The multiplayer mode where one chooses a word isn't fully implemented. All players can choose a word. The word of the player who creates the game will have precedence. Currently that player is still able to play the game.
# Sprint velocity:
* #User story number(estimated time) => (actual time)
* #80(3.5 days) => (3 days)
* #23(1 day) => (1 day)
* #51(2 days) => (1 day)
* #27(0 days) => (1 day)
* #39(1 day) => (3 days)
